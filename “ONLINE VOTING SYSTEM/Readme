The Project describes model of “Online Voting System using Python”
which basically does taking votes from voters, counting of votes, declaring of
result.
Firstly, with the help of dictionary names of candidates displayed on
the screen. The dictionary contains keys (names of candidates) and values (I’d
of candidates). Then we created a list containing I’d of voters. With the help of
I’d, voter can vote the candidates. Three variable names are created to count
the votes of candidates.
Main part of source code is while loop. While loop is used to count
the votes and display the result. If voter gave the vote already and still trying to
vote twice, then system displayed message that, “You already voted”.
Otherwise, voter have to enter their voting I’d and vote to any one candidate.
After every vote, “Thanks for voting will be displayed on screen. All votes are
counted for each candidate separately.
After completion of voting, “Voting is over” displayed on screen.
Then results are counted. We took here 3 candidates. If 1

st candidate has

maximum number of votes, then 1st candidate wins. If 2

nd candidate has

maximum number of votes, then 2nd candidate wins. If 3

rd candidate has

maximum number of votes, then 3

rd candidate wins.
